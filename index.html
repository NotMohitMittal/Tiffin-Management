        <p>The Tiffin Service Management System is designed to simplify and automate the process of managing student meal services. In many institutions, students may not require meals on certain days due to personal commitments or unforeseen circumstances. This system enables students to record their absence for specific dates and provide reasons, ensuring they are not charged for unused services. The program utilizes a user-friendly interface and integrates with an SQL database using JDBC to store and manage this information securely.</p>
        <p>This solution not only benefits students by saving costs but also helps service providers optimize resources, reduce food wastage, and streamline their operations.</p>
